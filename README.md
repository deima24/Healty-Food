# Healty-Food

This is the e-commerce application which is the last project to Code Institute portfolio projects.

Healthy Food is an online order shop where you can buy (order) food online and get delivered to you'r home. Shop offers variety of food which is healthy.
User can choose from vegan frendlly food such as meat free food, also we have food with meat and also healthy portions aswell. On the site there is 
also a review section (forum) where user can leave theyre experience from ordering from us.


## UI/UX

This website doesn't have any flashy features added to it. This is down to the fact that most expected customers will be surfing the site in good speed and not going to be overloaded 
with features that serve no purpose other than being showy. That way custumer can navigate in the site quickly.

## Agile

This project was designed and built using the agile approach. Right from the initial planning through to final development. To help visualise the process I created a GitHub project and utilised the provided Kanban board method to split project elements into user stories and manageable tasks.
